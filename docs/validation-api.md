# Validation API

`nhsmm.validation` provides domain-neutral evidence checks for learned context effects. Validation is deliberately separate from `NHSMM.optimize()`: training policy stays with the caller, while validation tests whether a fitted context effect reproduces across independent fits.

## Canonical public API

For normal application code, use the component-normalized facade exported directly from `nhsmm`:

```python
from nhsmm import (
    ContextEvidenceConfig,
    context_effect,
    evaluate_context_effect_replication,
    split_fit_context_effect_evidence,
)
```

All three operations take the same explicit component selector:

```text
component = "initial" | "duration" | "emission" | "transition"
```

The canonical operations are:

- `context_effect(model, context, component=...)`
- `evaluate_context_effect_replication(model_a, model_b, contexts, component=..., config=...)`
- `split_fit_context_effect_evidence(observations, context, component=..., fit_model=..., evidence_contexts=..., config=...)`

`ContextEffectComponent` is exported as the corresponding typing alias.

Semantic effect shapes are stable by component:

- `initial` -> normalized initial-state probabilities `[K]`;
- `duration` -> normalized duration probabilities `[K,D]`, including `duration_logits_bias`;
- `emission` -> state-conditioned emission means `[K,F]`;
- `transition` -> effective boundary-transition probabilities `[K,K]`, duration-integrated where applicable.

Example:

```python
from nhsmm import ContextEvidenceConfig, evaluate_context_effect_replication

policy = ContextEvidenceConfig(
    replication_corr_min=0.55,
    min_replica_amplitude=0.10,
)

evidence = evaluate_context_effect_replication(
    model_a,
    model_b,
    contexts=evidence_grid,
    component="duration",
    config=policy,
)
```

Thresholds are always explicit policy. Amplitude units are component-specific and therefore are not universal package defaults.

## Split-fit validation

`split_fit_context_effect_evidence(...)` creates two disjoint training partitions and delegates fitting back to the caller. The callback owns initialization, optimization, refinement, seeds, stopping rules, and application-specific training choices. Validation never calls or mutates `NHSMM.optimize()` itself.

## Semantics

Shared validation semantics are:

- two independent fits on disjoint training units;
- latent-state alignment from learned emission centers only;
- comparison on an explicit context evidence grid;
- selection requires both replicated direction and replicated effect size;
- no latent truth labels are needed;
- no domain-specific labels or trading assumptions are used.

Transition evidence retains its dedicated internal implementation because it has two latent-state axes and boundary semantics. The normalized facade hides that implementation distinction from normal callers.

## Internal implementation

Component-specific extraction and evidence helpers remain internal implementation details under `nhsmm.validation` modules. Application code should use the canonical component-selected facade above.

## Result objects

`ContextEvidence` contains `selected`, `replication_corr`, `direction_agreement`, `replica_amplitudes`, `min_replica_amplitude`, `state_alignment`, and `n_contexts`.

`SplitFitEvidence` adds `split_index` and `replica_sizes`.

These objects report evidence; they do not automatically enable, disable, prune, or retrain model components.


## Reproducible validation snapshots

For later train/OOS, walk-forward, replay, or deployment validation, use:

```python
from nhsmm import (
    evaluate_validation_snapshot,
    compare_validation_snapshots,
)

train = evaluate_validation_snapshot(model, train_x, label="train")
oos = evaluate_validation_snapshot(model, oos_x, label="oos")
comparison = compare_validation_snapshots(train, oos)
```

`ValidationSnapshot` records domain-neutral evidence without changing model state:

- deterministic model fingerprint from resolved config + state dict;
- deterministic data fingerprint and optional explicit-context fingerprint;
- sequence counts and original lengths;
- total, per-sequence, and per-timestep log likelihood;
- decoded state-switch rate and mean decoded run length;
- the full `ModelHealthReport`.

`compare_validation_snapshots(...)` reports reference-to-candidate deltas for likelihood, effective-state count, occupancy concentration, posterior entropy, switch rate, run length, and occupancy L1 distance. By default it requires the same fitted-model fingerprint, preventing accidental direct comparison of unaligned latent-state labels from independently fitted models.

Snapshots and comparisons expose `.as_dict()` and are JSON-serializable. They deliberately contain no timestamps or trading-specific labels so identical model/data inputs produce stable validation evidence.

## Validation configuration contract

Controlled learning/prediction acceptance uses a separate public configuration surface from `ModelConfig`:

- `ValidationConfig` — schema version, seeds, boundary tolerance, model template, health thresholds, data policy, and named scenarios;
- `ValidationDataConfig` — sequence counts/length and synthetic duration-generation policy;
- `ValidationScenarioConfig` — explicit learning and structural-usefulness thresholds.

The contract is strict and JSON-serializable. Unknown keys, unsupported schema versions, invalid ranges, incompatible dimensions, and contradictory policies fail closed. Tuning returns validated copies via `with_overrides(...)`; no scenario name carries hidden behavior.

See [configuration.md](configuration.md) for the full contract and CLI examples.
