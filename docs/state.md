# NHSMM State

Current package readiness and next package-level boundary. Detailed model semantics are in [model.md](model.md), configuration and tuning in [configuration.md](configuration.md), validation semantics and accepted package evidence in [validation.md](validation.md), verification policy in [testing.md](testing.md), and release procedure in [release.md](release.md).

## Current status

**Phase:** package-core hardening and validation are complete enough for the next integration gate. The current model core has been audited for distribution semantics, HSMM recursion, variable-length handling, runtime state, context routing, and Neural context modulation.

Current maintained defaults and contracts:

- ModelConfig.use_context_encoder=False; the internal ContextEncoder is opt-in.
- External context remains independently supported through context_dim.
- The canonical production causal path is the NHSMM causal filter/runtime contract documented in [model.md](model.md).
- n_states=3 remains the current Nautilus baseline from the maintained 3-vs-4 usability study.
- Historical machine-readable validation evidence is retained under [validation/README.md](validation/README.md).

## Accepted package-core evidence

Controlled package evidence currently supports these narrow claims:

- **Duration context:** PASS for strong/moderate recovery with a bounded null control.
- **Latent-state recovery:** PASS up to permutation when the controlled acceptance harness explicitly uses K-Means initialization.
- **Learning and held-out prediction:** PASS for the maintained strong/moderate/weak contracts; null remains a negative control.
- **Transition context:** PASS for strong/moderate recovery with near-zero null effect under the maintained refinement policy.
- **Multi-component identifiability:** package-core PASS across the frozen controlled gate.
- **General-context robustness:** package-core PASS under split-fit direction replication.

These claims are package/mechanism evidence only. They do not establish trading utility, market semantics, or downstream predictive value. See [validation.md](validation.md) for the maintained metrics, thresholds, and reproduction commands.

### Distribution and runtime

Closed and regression-tested:

- distribution initialization no longer double-applies context;
- emission/K-Means initialization preserves registered parameter identity;
- runtime score caches invalidate after parameter replacement;
- decode normalizes list input before batch-shape access;
- log_likelihood rejects positive infinity rather than mapping it to a finite maximum;
- unknown distribution activation names fail closed.

### Mathematical and PyTorch correctness

Independent checks verified:

- causal state-age filtering against probability-space brute force;
- non-causal forward likelihood and Viterbi against complete small-model segment/state enumeration;
- batch vs single-sequence likelihood and decoding consistency;
- Gaussian and Student-t emission likelihoods against PyTorch references.

Closed defects:

- variable-length list likelihood/training padding leakage;
- padded-row NaN autograd in forward recursions;
- duplicate public external-context routing;
- max_duration=1 empty duration-regularizer NaN;
- scheduled distribution temperatures excluded from the standard optimizer.

### Model boundary and lifecycle

Closed and regression-tested:

- public inference requires initialized distributions with a defined runtime error;
- observation rank, feature width, and finiteness validate at the model boundary;
- empty-sequence likelihood behavior is consistent;
- structurally incompatible optimize(..., cfg=...) configs fail closed;
- optimization preserves the caller's train/eval mode across restart-created distributions.

### ContextEncoder opt-in

The internal learned observation-derived context path is optional:

- default: no ContextEncoder, no distribution context networks unless external context capacity is explicitly configured;
- use_context_encoder=True enables the canonical internal encoder;
- passing an explicit encoder is also an opt-in;
- runtime, filtering, diagnostics, artifacts, and tests support both paths;
- artifact v1 accepts encoder_config=None and remains compatible with older encoder-bearing artifacts.

### Neural semantics

Closed and regression-tested:

- categorical log_prob rejects fractional, non-finite, and out-of-support labels instead of silently truncating them;
- emission context deltas remain state-centered while respecting max_delta;
- the unused internal Neural.alpha parameter was removed;
- temperature remains categorical-logit semantics and does not alter continuous emission location parameters.

## Verification

Latest code gate before this documentation-only consolidation:

    ruff check nhsmm tests scripts: PASS
    black --check nhsmm tests scripts: PASS
    pytest -q: 345 passed, 3 skipped

The three skips are CUDA-only tests on the CPU workspace.

## Nautilus usability boundary

The maintained 2026-10-05 3-vs-4 state-count study favored three states:

- 3-state runs were healthier and had slightly better mean OOS log likelihood per step;
- four states added soft posterior capacity without a hard-state usage gain;
- operational baseline therefore remains n_states=3.

That study predates the current real-data integration gate and is not a substitute for a fresh current-feature replay.

## Next package boundary

The next material acceptance step is outside additional package-core refactoring:

1. use the current Nautilus observation contract from the integration repository;
2. build a real chronological 18-D replay/fixture from the mounted Nautilus data;
3. run the current NHSMM end to end on that fixture;
4. verify causal behavior, state usage, OOS likelihood, runtime characteristics, and artifact round-trip;
5. keep integration ownership outside the NHSMM core package.

No unresolved package-core mathematical defect is currently known.
