# NHSMM State

Current package readiness and next package-level boundary. Detailed model semantics are in [model.md](model.md), configuration and tuning in [configuration.md](configuration.md), validation semantics and accepted package evidence in [validation.md](validation.md), verification policy in [testing.md](testing.md), and release procedure in [release.md](release.md).

## Current status

**Phase:** package-core hardening and validation are complete enough for the next integration gate. The current model core has been audited for distribution semantics, HSMM recursion, variable-length handling, runtime state, context routing, and Neural context modulation.

Current maintained defaults and contracts:

- ModelConfig.use_context_encoder=False; the internal ContextEncoder is opt-in.
- External context remains independently supported through context_dim.
- The canonical production causal path is the NHSMM causal filter/runtime contract documented in [model.md](model.md).
- n_states=3 remains the current Nautilus baseline from the maintained 3-vs-4 usability study.
- Historical machine-readable validation evidence is retained under [validation/README.md](validation/README.md).
- The full controlled package acceptance suite was re-run batchwise on 2026-10-06 after the ContextEncoder opt-in migration; duration, state recovery, learning/prediction, and transition-context gates all passed.

## Accepted package-core evidence

Controlled package evidence currently supports these narrow claims:

- **Duration context:** PASS for strong/moderate recovery with a bounded null control.
- **Latent-state recovery:** PASS up to permutation when the controlled acceptance harness explicitly uses K-Means initialization.
- **Learning and held-out prediction:** PASS for the maintained strong/moderate/weak contracts; null remains a negative control.
- **Transition context:** PASS for strong/moderate recovery with near-zero null effect under the maintained refinement policy.
- **Multi-component identifiability:** package-core PASS across the frozen controlled gate.
- **General-context robustness:** package-core PASS under split-fit direction replication.

These claims are package/mechanism evidence only. They do not establish trading utility, market semantics, or downstream predictive value. See [validation.md](validation.md) for the maintained metrics, thresholds, and reproduction commands.

## Production hardening closed on 2026-10-05/06

### Distribution and runtime

Closed and regression-tested:

- distribution initialization no longer double-applies context;
- emission/K-Means initialization preserves registered parameter identity;
- runtime score caches invalidate after parameter replacement;
- decode normalizes list input before batch-shape access;
- log_likelihood rejects positive infinity rather than mapping it to a finite maximum;
- unknown distribution activation names fail closed.

### Mathematical and PyTorch correctness

Independent checks verified:

- causal state-age filtering against probability-space brute force;
- non-causal forward likelihood and Viterbi against complete small-model segment/state enumeration;
- batch vs single-sequence likelihood and decoding consistency;
- Gaussian and Student-t emission likelihoods against PyTorch references.

Closed defects:

- variable-length list likelihood/training padding leakage;
- padded-row NaN autograd in forward recursions;
- duplicate public external-context routing;
- max_duration=1 empty duration-regularizer NaN;
- scheduled distribution temperatures excluded from the standard optimizer.

### Model boundary and lifecycle

Closed and regression-tested:

- public inference requires initialized distributions with a defined runtime error;
- observation rank, feature width, and finiteness validate at the model boundary;
- empty-sequence likelihood behavior is consistent;
- structurally incompatible optimize(..., cfg=...) configs fail closed;
- optimization preserves the caller's train/eval mode across restart-created distributions and validation failures;
- model construction owns a resolved config copy, so explicit encoder injection cannot mutate a reusable caller config and leak Neural opt-in into later models;
- variable-length external context validates against `context_dim` independently of observation feature width.

### ContextEncoder opt-in

The internal learned observation-derived context path is optional:

- default: no ContextEncoder, no distribution context networks unless external context capacity is explicitly configured;
- use_context_encoder=True enables the canonical internal encoder;
- passing an explicit encoder is also an opt-in;
- runtime, filtering, diagnostics, artifacts, and tests support both paths;
- artifact v1 accepts encoder_config=None and remains compatible with older encoder-bearing artifacts.

### Neural semantics

Closed and regression-tested:

- categorical log_prob rejects fractional, non-finite, and out-of-support labels instead of silently truncating them;
- emission context deltas remain state-centered while respecting max_delta;
- the unused internal Neural.alpha parameter was removed;
- temperature remains categorical-logit semantics and does not alter continuous emission location parameters;
- categorical temperature controls fail closed for non-finite/non-positive values and their stored parameters are frozen;
- context-free `delta_scale` controls are frozen because they are behaviorally inactive without context networks.

## Verification

Latest standalone core gate after the package audit fixes:

    ruff check nhsmm tests scripts: PASS
    black --check nhsmm tests scripts: PASS
    git diff --check: PASS
    focused regression suite: 131 passed
    python -m pytest -q: 360 passed, 3 skipped

The three skips are CUDA-only tests on the CPU workspace. A public-API artifact/inference/runtime round-trip also passed: artifact save/load preserved batch likelihood exactly, artifact-loaded and `load_inference_model(...)` runtimes produced identical posteriors across 17 causal streaming steps, state/age posteriors remained normalized, reset semantics passed, inference parameters were frozen, and variable-length list likelihood remained finite.

Full controlled revalidation on 2026-10-06 also passed:

- duration context: strong/moderate/null PASS;
- latent-state recovery: strong/moderate/null PASS;
- learning/prediction: strong/moderate/weak learning+usefulness PASS; null learning-control PASS with usefulness not applicable;
- transition context: strong/moderate/null PASS.

The validation harnesses were run in scenario-sized batches with persistent JSON artifacts under the AWA workspace work store. See [validation.md](validation.md) for the current measured summaries.

## Nautilus usability boundary

The maintained 2026-10-05 3-vs-4 state-count study favored three states:

- 3-state runs were healthier and had slightly better mean OOS log likelihood per step;
- four states added soft posterior capacity without a hard-state usage gain;
- operational baseline therefore remains n_states=3.

That study predates the current real-data integration gate and is not a substitute for a fresh current-feature replay.

## Next package boundary

No further package-core refactoring is currently required by the maintained acceptance evidence. The next NHSMM work should be driven by a new core defect, a deliberate model/API change, or a package-level performance/validation objective.

Downstream Nautilus integration is intentionally deferred and is not part of the current NHSMM core acceptance gate. When resumed, it remains owned outside this repository and must be revalidated against the then-current downstream framework/runtime contract.

No unresolved package-core mathematical defect is currently known.
